			<h1>About us</h1>
				<p> Hello, my name is Charline Galarza, I am a 23 year old college student. Many instances I have wanted to do an interesting research paper but can never find websites with adequate amount of information in them or even understand the wording in them. My main goal in <i>The Killing</i> is to inform individuals about some of the most infamous serial killers to shed light and information on their story that can help us understand why they did what they did and try to learn how we can help minimize these crimes  by understanding some of their stories. We provide their life before becoming serial killers from being a child to an adult and we also provide details on the grueling and most horrifying acts of violence that these serial killers have commited. The following serial killers that will be mentioned in this website are <i>Ted Bundy, The Zodiac Killer, Jeffrey Dahmer</i> and <i>Ed Gein.</i> This website is not meant to glorify these serial killers nor the crimes committed by them, this is merely an informational page.</p>
