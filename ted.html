	  <p>Ted Bundy (<i>Theodore Robert Cowell</i>) was born in November 24, 1946 to <i>Eleanor Louise Cowell</i> in Burlington, Vermont. Although there is many men who are suspected to be Bundy's father, his father was always unknown as states his birth certificate. To hide the fact that his mother had him out of wedlock his very religious grandparents demanded that his mother would be known as his sister, and that is what Bundy thought for most of his life. His grandfather <i>Samuel Cowell,</i> who Bundy believed to be his father was a racist, sexist and abusive man but to Ted Bundy he was the prime example of what a man should be and looked up to him. Bundy would often sneak into his grandfathers greenhouse to watch his pornography collection that in an interview Bundy blamed porn for corrupting him.</p>
		<p>In 1950 Bundy's mother left with him and moved to Tacoma, Washington to live with her two cousins. There she met <i>Johnny Culpepper Bundy</i> and they got married in 1951 and Johnny formally adopted Bundy but they had four other children of their own. On many ocassions Bundy was caught peeping through windows and shoplifting, and was arrested at least twice on suspicion of burglary and auto theft. </p>
