    <p><i>Lionel</i> and <i>Joyce Dahmer</i> had <i>Jeffrey Dahmer</i> in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on May 21, 1960. Athough described as a loving mother, Dahmer's mother Joyce suffered from depression and attempted suicide, which she was hospitalized for. Dahmer's father Lionel was mostly absent with his work, when Lionel was at home he and Dahmer had a peculiar father and son activity, they would bleach the connective tissue and the hair off animal corpses when they found animals whoâ€™d died under their house. However, for his father it was for his work as he was a research chemist. According to his parents he was a normal, happy and energetic child until he had surgery at the age of 4 years old to correct a double hernia. As he got older his parents described him as shy and showed little to no social interactions or hobbies. However, a hobbie no one knew about was collecting, dismembering and impaling dead animals. Dahmer collected animal carcasses from the roadside, he would then dismember them and would collect their parts and store them in jars.</p>
	  <p>In his early teens Dahmer started his fantasies on controlling and dominating male partners. In on of his interviews Dahmer stated that he would have commited his first crime when he was 16 years old, he explained that there was this male jogger whom he have had various fantasies about commiting sexual acts with his unconcious body. Dahmer had hid in some bushes with a baseball bat to lay in wait for this man, but was disappointed when in that particular day the man did not pass. </p>
	  <p>In 1977 Dahmer's parents divorced and his parents both moved out of their home to live with some relatives, but Dahmer decided to stay in the home as he had just turned 18. </p><br><br>

    <p> In 1978 Dahmer graduated high school and three weeks after he commited his first murder. Dahmer picked up a hitchhiker named <i>Steven Hicks</i> and invited him into the family home to drink beer. They spent hours drinking and listening to music when Hicks at one point decided to leave, Dahmer explained that he did not want him to leave and for that reason he hit him in the back of the head with a 10 lb barbell. When Hicks fell unconcious to the ground Dahmer killed him by strangling him. The following day Dahmer dismembered, dissolved, pulverized, and scattered the remains around the backyard of his home.</p>
	  <p>After his father and his new fiancÃ© returned to his home and found Dahmer living alone, he decided to enroll in a university to only drop out due to his alcoholism. In 1979 Lionel, Dahmers father forced him to enlist in the army, which he then did and trained as a medical specialist. After two years in 1981 he was discharged due to once again his alcoholism.</p>
	  <p>After nine years from his first victim Dahmer killed again in 1987 a man called <i>Steven Tuomi.</i> Dahmer lured Tuomi to a hotel room he rented for the evening. He stated that his intentions were not to kill Tuomi but drug him and have sex with his body. Dahmer explained that he awoke the next morning to Tuomis body underneath the bed beated, he stated that he did not recall the murder of Tuomi and "could not believe this had happened."</p>
	  <p>After his second murder Dahmer began to look for more victims, whom he lured into his grandmothers home. He killed two men in 1988, one in 1989, and four in 1990. Dahmer was also arrested for drugging and fondling a 13 year old, he was given five years of probation and was registered as a sex offender. Dahmer became obsessed with the idea of turning his victims into "zombies" that he could control. In 1991 one of his victims while lobotomized was able to escape and Dahmers neighbors called the police because there was a boy walking the streets naked. Dahmer was succesful in convincing the police that the boy was his 19 year old lover whom was intoxicated. The boy however was 14 years old being his youngest victim. After the police left Dahmer proceeded to fully kill the boy. </p>
	  <p>On 1991 Dahmer lured a man called Tracy Edwards into his home just like all of his other victims. Dahmer forced Edwards into his room but he sucessfuly escaped and flagged down a police car, which he then explained everything to. The police found photographs of his victims body and dismembered limbs. When investigating more they also found a severed head in the fridge, seven around his home and a heart in the freezer. Although Dahmer pled insanity for his crimes he was declared sane and guilty on 16 murder charges. </p>
